# cipher-scan.sh

A script that uses openssl to scan for different Ciphers available on a TLS/SSL secured service

I found myself in need of a simple tool run against a specific server / port while remediating a large number of servers and services. 
This script will connect to any SSL/TLS service like WWW/Email/LDAPS and so on.

It requires OpenSSL and coreutils packages to be installed. ( OpenSSL for openssl s_client, coreutils for the timeout command )
